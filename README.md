# o1 and Inference Time Scaling

These are the slides I gave for a 45 minute talk at a Halihax data science meetup November, 2024.

Goal:
- To give the listener a strong intuition for why reasoning is effective
- To explain why reasoning models were challenging to make initially

Basic sentiment:
- CoT and reasoning models are good, and a big deal
- They're not AGI

Caveats:
- I added a lot verbally that isn't in the slides (these might not make great reading material)
- I underestimated OpenAI's ability to increase output quality by just cranking out more CoT (though this may just involve many runs and best-of-n sampling)
